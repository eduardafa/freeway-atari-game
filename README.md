Originally, Freeway is an action video game written by David Crane for the Atari 2600 and published by Activision in 1981.

**Instructions:**
<br>
One player control a cow who can be made to run across a six lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to "get to the other side". Every time the cow gets across a point is earned for the player. If hit by a car, the cow is pushed back to the bottom of the screen. The game has no winner because, for now, there is just one player.

**Controls:**
<br>
You can movement the cow using the up and down keys from your keyboard.
